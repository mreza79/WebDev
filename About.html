      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been captivated by the intricate world of technology,
        particularly Backend Development. The behind-the-scenes magic that
        powers websites and applications has fueled my curiosity, prompting me
        to delve deeper into the intricacies of server-side programming,
        databases, and optimizing system performance. As I navigate the
        ever-evolving landscape of programming languages and frameworks, I am
        continually fascinated by the challenges and innovations that define
        this dynamic field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the digital realm, my interests extend to the fascinating realm
        of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As someone who
        either grapples with this condition or knows someone who does, I am
        committed to understanding the multifaceted aspects of ADHD, from its
        neurological underpinnings to the diverse strategies for managing and
        thriving with it. Exploring the intersection of technology and ADHD
        interventions is a particularly engaging facet of my research. I seek to
        leverage the power of innovation to enhance the quality of life for
        individuals navigating the challenges of ADHD.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a departure from the digital and neurological spheres, my
        intellectual curiosity extends to Bioinformatics. The convergence of
        biology, computer science, and information technology has resulted in a
        field revolutionizing our understanding of living organisms at the
        molecular level. My research endeavors in Bioinformatics involve
        unraveling the complexities of biological data, from genomic sequences
        to protein structures, and applying computational methods to extract
        meaningful insights. The potential for bioinformatics to revolutionize
        healthcare, drug discovery, and personalized medicine motivates me to
        explore this interdisciplinary field further.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, my research interests span technology, neuroscience, and
        biology. Whether immersed in the intricacies of backend development,
        exploring the nuances of ADHD, or deciphering the biological code
        through bioinformatics, I am driven by a passion for unraveling the
        mysteries that shape our digital and biological landscapes. As I embark
        on this intellectual journey, I am excited to contribute to the ongoing
        discourse in these fields and uncover new avenues for innovation and
        understanding.
